## Overview

This is my take on a weather application! I have been progressing through [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com) for roughly a year and half while being a stay-at-home parent. This project is currently my pride and joy due to it being the first project I made that uses an API to display information!

I am currently back in school for my B.S. in Computer Science so I am trying to juggle school, personal projects, parenting and showing old projects the love they deserve!

This project is a weather application that allows a user to look at local and foreign weather by search. It uses WeatherAPI to generate accurate weather.

## Features

- Hourly Weather: This app displays hourly weather for up to 5 hours.
- Different Conditions: It also displays different weather conditions such as wind speed/direction or moon phase.


### Installation

Simply clone the repo to your system and run "npm install" in order to grab the dependencies and you should be set!
